# GDS_Processing
GDS_Processing is a MATLAB library to enable RF analog integrated-circuit designers to convert and manipulate GDS structures and then export them to Cadence layout without DRC errors. I needed a tool during my PhD to move designs from HFSS to Cadence layout without drawing the designs manually again in Cadence. Refere to the [ppt file](https://github.com/zainkhalifa/GDS_Processing/blob/master/GDS_Processing.pptx) for a quick overview. Although, I made this library for this specific application, I have created many general functions for GDS files that you might find useful. 

Note: This library depends on the work of Ulf Griesmann in his [gdsii-toolbox](https://github.com/ulfgri/gdsii-toolbox). My files includes his work.
